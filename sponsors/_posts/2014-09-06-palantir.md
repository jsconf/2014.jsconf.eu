Palantir Technologies builds software products to transform the way the world's most important organizations use data to solve their biggest problems. We care deeply about user interface design, and constantly strive to make analysis of large-scale data and collaboration across teams more intuitive. We believe that smooth interaction between people and technology allows users to ask deeper questions of their data, get clearer answers, and make better decisions for their organizations.

The problems we solve every day are fundamentally about people. As members of the JavaScript community, this is why we support the organizer's mission of making technology better, more diverse, and more human. For more information about who we are and what we do, see www.palantir.com.
