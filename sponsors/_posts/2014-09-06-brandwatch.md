Brandwatch is one of the world’s best social technology companies. We help over 1000 businesses listen, analyse and act on conversations happening all over the web.

With such an accomplished and robust platform, we've embraced JavaScript and heavily use it across our products, both on the client and on the server with node.js. We're passionate about open source, and want to give back to the community by sponsoring JSCONF EU.
