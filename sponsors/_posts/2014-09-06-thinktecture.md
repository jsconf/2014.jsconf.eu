- We were .NET developers on the client, but have seen the light ;)
- We *love* AngularJS
- We are a small group of passionate developers in Southern Germany (BY and BW)
- We help developers architect and build AngularJS browser and hybrid apps
- Oh ... and we promise to continue our work on http://henriquat.re :)
