description: "Scaling Node applications from prototyping stacks to production can be very difficult as there is a big lack of conventions and best practices that work across companies and even communities. In this talk Tim will be showcasing his favourite 4 modules of KrakenJS – a thin convention layer on top of Express – which helped PayPal pushing out Node apps.

Learn some key findings that PayPal made when working on Node and how we structured the introduction of it into our existing infrastructure. Being more efficient, needing less people working on projects and being way more responsive than classical apps Node and Kraken have become PayPal's favourite stack."
